- **auto workshop** craft resources when full
  - only when > 95% full and doesn't craft all so you have always some available
- **auto hunt** when catpower full
  - next to start: 1,2,3 and 4 stand for parchment, manuscript, compendium, blueprint
- **auto trade** trade button enables auto trade with zebras but if uranium amount is < 5, it will trade for that first 
- **export/import** makes savegame export and _copies code to clipboard_ // import only opens import window and selects the textarea, because I couldn't get pasting to work. but simply ctrl-v tab return return does the trick...  
- **auto observe** auto collection of star charts.

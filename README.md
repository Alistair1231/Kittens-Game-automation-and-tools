**Apart from trading and parchment, manuscript, ... automation everything is handled by the start button (the other ones have their own buttons) so if you want to temporarily want todisable them just hit save and reload **  
- **auto pray** clicks pray when faith full
- **auto workshop** craft resources when full
  - only when > 95% full and doesn't craft all so you have always some available
- **auto hunt** when catpower full
  - next to start: 1,2,3 and 4 stand for parchment, manuscript, compendium, blueprint
- **auto trade** trade button enables auto trade with zebras but if uranium amount is < 5, it will trade for that first 
- **export/import** makes savegame export and _copies code to clipboard_ // import only opens import window and selects the textarea, because I couldn't get pasting to work. but simply ctrl-v tab return return does the trick...  
- **auto observe** auto collection of star charts.
